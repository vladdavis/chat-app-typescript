A Chat application for the Web using React, Redux.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can use:

### `npm start`

to run the chat-application and server for websocket.
*Don't forget to run* `npm install` *before*

### Another way

You can also use these scripts (showed below) to run the client chat-application and server in two different terminals.

To run the client chat-application:
#### `npm run front-end`

To run server:
#### `npm run back-end`

*You should run the application using this way to simulate server errors (server is not available etc.)*

## Technologies:

* React/Redux
* WebSockets for chat functionality
* REST for login
* Implement your own redux middleware for dispatching asynchronous actions
* Implement your own redux middleware for WebSockets interaction
* Typescript
